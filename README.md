Should I consider dirty recting
-> significantly decreases total iteration  
-> per pixelchange, (min, max)*2 (four if-statements!!!) +figuring out where to store (probably needs some kind of accessing too)
-> figuring some kind of acces
-> will probably only yield any returns when using larger subchunks

-> should I profile or just implement both with compiler settings : )
